VPN Chrome is Google Chromium based browser with built-in VPN capability to let users surf the Internet in a secure and private way.

Chromium is a free and open-source web browser project, mainly developed and maintained by Google. This codebase provides the vast majority of code for the Google Chrome browser, which is proprietary software and has some additional features.

The Chromium codebase is widely used. Microsoft Edge, Samsung Internet, Opera, and many other browsers are based on the Chromium code. Moreover, significant portions of the code are used by several app frameworks.

Google does not provide an official stable version of the Chromium browser, but does provide official API keys for some features, such as speech to text and translation.
